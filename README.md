### Directory Organization

- `docs`: contains presentations and documentation material _(not important)_
- `dev`: contains unit purpose software developed to understand, experiment and support the development of the work. It's good to dive into to get a simplified understanding of how things can be done (_e.g. read/write tags, middleware and EPCIS architecture_).
- `thesis`: source text and latex classes of the thesis
