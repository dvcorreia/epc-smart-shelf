  abstract = {A smart shelf is an object identification system that uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and LED indicators to quickly locate a specific object. The RFID is a powerful technology, which is vastly used for object identification. However, this system comes with challenges such as noise, interference from collocated RFID modules and higher power consumption for the passive RFID. This paper describes a system that uses an RFID module to harvest energy from an incoming radio signal both to power the circuitry in order to identify the object and to power an indicator LED. Also it describes how interferences between collocated tags can be minimized through the innovative use of aluminum and magnetic shielding.},

  abstract = {In the framework of Near-field (NF) UHF-RFID applications, a large number of ad-hoc antennas have been proposed in the last decade. In particular, the authors recently proposed novel reconfigurable antenna configurations, the so-called Modular Antennas. In these layouts, a travelling wave antenna is combined with a low-gain resonating antenna, which share the surface of the desktop reader antenna. Specifically, a spiral Travelling Wave Antenna (TWA) is used to generate a strong and uniform field in proximity of the antenna surface. Then, such a microstrip transmission line is used to feed the resonating antenna in order to extend the reading range up to few decimeters. Also, to make the antenna almost scalable, several antenna solutions have been proposed, so spreading the generated field in a large and arbitrarily shaped area.},

It enables a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID-equipped robot to provide the precise locations of passive UHF RFID tagged items. First, the robot navigates and fully covers a target space to collect observation of RFID tags using a COTS reader at variable RF transmission power. Every observation is associated with a pose, where the robot receives the response, and the RF transmission power. When the robot collects all responses from an RFID tag, BFVP can estimate the location of the tag, hence, localizing the tagged item. We tested the performance of BFVP in a mock apparel store; it exhibits less than 0.5-m localization error in the practical retail environment with significant multipath fading. Our proposed BFVP could enable promising applications that could greatly improve the efficiency of supply chain management by providing the precise locations of RFID tagged items.},

Nevertheless, the requirements that an RFID tag should satisfy in the different steps of the supply chain, cannot be met by general purpose commercial tags, whose adoption would lead to low-performance systems. In this paper, we are presenting the properties of an ad hoc Ultra High Frequency (UHF) tag, designed and realized in order to work properly in the entire supply chain. The proposed tag has been tested to trace some critical pharmaceutical products, containing metals and liquids, and has been compared with a pre-selected commercial tag. Both tags mount the same chip. The very impressive results, reported in this paper, clearly demonstrate that well-designed ad hoc tags effectively improve the performance of any item-level tracing system.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a measurement method for tagged item classification in radio frequency identification (RFID)-based smart drawers. Specifically, the amplitude of the signal backscattered by the UHF-RFID passive tags attached to the items inside the drawer is used to identify at which of an assigned set of drawer subregions each detected tag belongs to. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) may be acquired by almost any UHF-RFID commercial reader chipset compatible with the Electronic Product Code (EPC) Class1 Gen2 protocol. The RSSI model in terms of the position of the tag inside the drawer is introduced, and its selective properties are discussed through both numerical data and measurements. The cases of a single reader antenna measuring during natural opening/closing operations as well as of multiple reader antennas measuring when the drawer is static are investigated. The measurement method performance is shown through an experimental analysis in a realistic scenario, where the RSSI values are collected by using commercial UHF-RFID hardware components, and then used as the feature vector of the classification algorithm. As an example, two different classifiers are used to map each detected tag to one of the regions that the drawer is subdivided into. The classification performance of the method based on a single antenna exploiting the drawer natural sliding movements is comparable to that achievable with multiple reader antennas, while representing a cost-effective and easy-to-implement practical solution.},

These spots occur in low electric field area of the electromagnetic standing wave, causing degradation of the tag's readability [3], [4]. In this paper, we present standing wave suppression technology by employing the SWC (Standing Wave Canceller). The SWC is a conductive film or dielectric with reflectance (r), installed at a specific distance (Ls) from the reflecting wall. Thus, a part of the electric field is reflected at the SWC (Efr), while another part (Etr) with phase contrast ({$\varphi$}) penetrates into the SWC and is reflected at the wall. These are synthesized into the total reflection electric field (Er = Efr + Etr) at the SWC. When Efr and Etr are anti-phase with respect to each other, e.g., the SWC is installed at the position Ls = {$\lambda$}g/4 ({$\varphi$} = {$\pi$}), Er is reduced and the standing wave is suppressed. Our SWC was able to improve tag readability, eliminating the dead-spot and saving power (4.7 dB) during tag-reading experiments in a metallic shelf.},

Compared to other applications, it has some unique requirements: 1) Confined read region to avoid the cross reads to other tiers and shelves; 2) Positioning capability to know where along the shelf the tag is; 3) Low total system cost to support many shelves in the application. In this paper, an innovative UHF RFID solution is proposed for the RFID shelf. It contains two key technologies. First, the proposed near field (NF) shelf antenna in [1] is improved to provide the possibility to connect 5 cascaded antennas to one antenna port. It can save the system cost by reducing the number of needed readers. Second, a phase difference measurement based tag positioning method is proposed. To support different applications, it can provide both tier level and item level positioning for the goods on the shelf. Based on the measurement results, the proposed method can get the item level positioning accuracy with an average error of 4.16cm. It can also get 100\% tier level positioning accuracy.},

  issn = {null},
  abstract = {in this paper the use of simple transmission lines as ``near-field antenna'' for Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) applications is proposed. The limitation of the reading/identification zone to the ``near field'' region of the antenna is a challenging problem for UHF RFID application. Several solutions have been proposed during past years but most of them are complicate and expensive in the final implementation. In this paper a very simple solution based on a transmission line concept will show that is possible to achieve a limitation of the reading zone in a simple and effective way by using very simple ``antenna'' or better to say: ``coupling mechanism system between RF signal generated by RFID reader and UHF RFID Tag''.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a patch antenna designed for Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) reader including a reconfigurable feeding for achieving polarization agility. The switchable polarization improves the polarization efficiency in comparison with standard circular polarized antenna solutions. CMOS switches are used in the reconfigurable feeding network for enabling higher power transmission and uncomplicated control with respect to solutions involving varactors and PIN diodes. Moreover, the designed patch antenna and ground planes have reduced size, for best integration of the reader in the required application. The combination of antenna and reconfigurable feeding network has been tested through simulations, showing good performance over the EU RFID frequency band (865-868 MHz). Due to its flexible and inexpensive structure, the proposed reconfigurable feeding system is a promising alternative to standard circular polarized reader antenna approaches.},
